### ## Key Features

-   **AI-Driven Logic Synthesis**: Translates behavioral or structural Verilog (e.g., `assign` statements) into a clean, professional gate-level schematic with standard logic symbols.
-   **Automated Testbench Generation**: Creates a ready-to-use Verilog testbench for any given module, significantly reducing the time and effort required for functional verification.
-   **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use, intuitive user experience that allows for file uploads and interactive controls.
-   **Multi-Module Support**: Automatically detects and allows the user to select from multiple modules within a single uploaded Verilog file.
-   **Debugging and Verification**: Provides the AI-generated logic expressions alongside the schematic, allowing for easy verification and debugging of the synthesized logic.
